Hello, i'm a e-commerce =)

I'm a project created to study SOLID, Repository pattern, Docker, AWS Service, Typescript, and why not, provide some fun!



### How to start
After install Docker run:
```
1 - yarn install
2 - yarn migration:generate
3 - yarn migration:run
4 - docker compose up
```

ps: In future releases migration commands will be runned before docker container starts by entrypoint, so maybe you don't need to run this commands.
